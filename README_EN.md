> **Design philosophy:** Intelligence lives in the LLM; the scaffold is just a loop. 42+ tools, 7-layer security, 4-layer compaction, multi-agent coordination — all of it is a **production-grade harness** wrapped around this loop.

## 🔑 Key Insights Preview

### 1. The Core Loop Is Deliberately "Dumb"

Claude Code's `query()` function is a simple AsyncGenerator loop: send messages → get response → if tool_use, execute tool → push result → repeat. All intelligence lives in the LLM. This is a deliberate architectural choice — a "dumb scaffold, smart model" philosophy.

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination Is a First-Class Feature

The Coordinator mode transforms Claude Code from a single-agent CLI into an orchestrator that dispatches parallel worker agents. Workers are fully isolated — they can't see the coordinator's conversation history. The coordinator must synthesize worker results and craft self-contained prompts.

### 3. Dead Code Elimination via Feature Flags

`bun:bundle` feature flags are used at build time to completely strip unused code paths. Voice mode, proactive mode, coordinator mode — all are gated behind compile-time flags, producing a smaller binary.

### 4. Permission System Uses Defense-in-Depth

Permissions are checked at multiple levels: app-level config rules → tool-specific permission models → OS-level sandbox (seccomp on Linux, seatbelt on macOS). When sandbox is active, certain operations auto-approve — trading application-layer checks for kernel-level guarantees.
